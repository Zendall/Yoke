f_project-summary: >-
  There is a slight distinction between wine drinkers and beer drinkers in the
  Midwest. This web app needed to consider the interests and behaviors of both
  while catering primarily to the wine drinker. The Drink KY experience should
  make it easy to plan social outings to new places with content that
  differentiates what the consumer can expect from each location. It should
  identify if there are food options to pair with the wine and beer tastings and
  note any unique factors about each location and its offerings when possible.

  This client was extremely collaborative, and worked with us through multiple
  Figma workshops to solve problems and review work. The app was built with map
  integrations, location services, account management, a rewards dashboard, and
  more. Our team also built a marketing site to pair with the app experience to
  further educate users and drive traffic to app downloads, since the original
  app was going to be removed from all app stores.


  We are currently working toward a second phase to integrate post-launch
  findings and incorporate more social media functionalities such as following
  friends, sharing notes as posts, and a social feed.

  The overarching KPI was the amount of app downloads. The content strategy
  goals were to drive consumers to Kentucky’s tasting and tap rooms, provide an
  engaging user experience, and educate consumers about the unique wine and beer
  experiences in Kentucky.

Our team provided a UX/UI guide that aligned to the goals of the project. I used those findings to build wireframes that catered to our two personas representing wine and beer drinkers. The brand tone was already established by the parent brand, KyProud, as well as the Drink KY logo, so I referenced this to extend the color palette and create new branded elements.
