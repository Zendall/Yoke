  To complete the campaign, we worked with our PR and Media teams to integrate
  digital ads, outdoor, and location-tied activations such as coasters at local
  bars and fliers in public restrooms. The main call-to-actions for every single
  advertisement were to find support resources or to become a volunteer. This
  paired with minimal, but emotive, design treatments allowed for the message to
  reach our target audience loud and clear.

In the healthcare world, specifically through programs in Ohio, the color that is used to represent sexual assault victim support is teal, usually used as a ribbon. When designing the logo the prominent color was teal, and eventually blue was pulled in from the parent brand: OhioHealth. Initial concepts consisted of ribbons, speech bubbles, connected shapes, and more.

The key was representing community, support, and communication. This eventually led us to the current mark – two abstracted speech bubbles, representing outreach and support, that connect to create the SARNCO 'S'.
