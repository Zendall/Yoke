  We delivered a minimal, responsive, organized, and effective website for a
  very difficult industry sector. We met the goals of the project by including a
  prominent "Contact Us" call-to-action, enhanced product filtering, and
  well-organized descriptions of applications and products with additional
  downloadable resources when needed.

Our biggest hurdle was eliminating redundancies in content, and consolidating information where possible to simplify the sitemap and user flow. The original website had several pain points: no way of filtering through products, duplicate content on different pages, and it wasn't mobile-responsive.

My immediate team performed a content audit, refined their sitemap, organized their content architecture, created personas, made wireframes, and built a global design elements system, all while honing in on a refreshed brand tone to convey through their new site.
