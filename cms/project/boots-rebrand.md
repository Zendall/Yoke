  The (2017) logotype has not changed much in the 160 year span that Boots has
  been in business. The brand as it stands today is trusted by many, but is seen
  as outdated and needs to feel progressive, while still approachable.

  This was my first exploration of a full rebrand, from creating the logo to
  writing the brand standards. I was engaged by needing to pull from multiple
  parts of my design-thinking wheelhouse like UX research, packaging design, and
  even copywriting.


  Looking back on this work, I believe this rebrand was maybe too far of a jump
  forward, and I think the current rebrand by Coley Porter Bell is more
  appropriate for how Boots is currently positioned. However, pushing myself to
  create something unexpected for Boots was a fun learning experience.

  Execute a hypothetical rebrand for the UK's leading health and beauty
  retailer. Boots is an icon, and this needs to be reflected in a single, iconic
  mark.

To prepare for this rebrand, I performed a company history audit and competitor audit. The goal of these audits was to learn what was already in the market, and how Boots positioned themselves in that market. Additional research methods for this rebrand were creating personas, refining Boot's mission statement, creating mood boards, and sketching logo possibilities that felt reminiscent of the previous mark, but still new and fresh.

Interestingly enough, a few years after I completed this project in school an actual rebrand of Boots was released. Read about the 2020 rebrand of Boots, by Coley Porter Bell, [here](https://www.coleyporterbell.com/case_study/boots-us/).
