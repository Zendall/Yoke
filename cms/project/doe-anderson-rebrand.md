Once everything was finalized, we plastered our new acorn all over new hire packets, our in-person office, social channels, and the side of our building."

We knew that the acorn had been the main mark for the entire history of the company, well, almost the entire history... this was the most identifiable part of the brand; the most recognizable across all our channels. This core element served as a starting point to build out themes of nature to breathe new life into the brand. We gave a name and a vision to what it meant to be a part of Doe-Anderson through company-wide values, and completely re-built our web presence.
